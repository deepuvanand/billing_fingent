# billing_fingent

Can copy the project files directly to the local server.

Need to rename the file "1.htaccess" to ".htaccess".

The database backup is available in the root folder iself. Need to import that one also.

The project name should be "billing_fingent" and the database name should be same as the sql file in the root folder.
